### Caloosahatchee River

```{r ,fig.align="center",out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://res.cloudinary.com/sanibel-captiva-conservation-foundation-recon/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1492528911/ykycqy8te1jzihaue7se.png')
```

* Historically the river was not connected to Lake Okeechobee

--

* Channelized river and estuary are challenged by extremes of too much or too little water

--

* In 2011, SCCF policy staff developed a weekly report of Caloosahatchee, estuary and coastal conditions to provide real time conditions to water managers at USACE and SFWMD

### Caloosahatchee River

* Great reports that consolidated a lot of information into 1 - 2 pages
  * [Jan 18th report](https://www.sccf.org/downloadable-files/61e880e516a93c8e4a96456c.pdf)

### How It's Made (pre-2021)

1. visit [USACE](https://w3.saj.usace.army.mil/h2o/reports.htm) Daily Reports webpage
  * Check Lake Okeechobee Net Inflows - [link](https://w3.saj.usace.army.mil/h2o/reports/r-lonin.html)
  * Check Lake Okeechobee Net Outflows - [link](https://w3.saj.usace.army.mil/h2o/reports/r-lonf.html)
  * Check Lake Okeechobee & Vicinity - [Link](https://w3.saj.usace.army.mil/h2o/reports/r-oke.html)
  * Verify spillway volumes (S77, S78, S79, etc.) & Check rainfall values 

--

2. Copy all data into spreadsheet to summarize and convert data

--

3. Check HAB update - 
  * Red Tide (*Karina brevis*) Check FWC Red tide update - [link](https://myfwc.com/research/redtide/statewide/)
      * If in bloom period (Sept to December) check bloom map/remote sensing info
  * Freshwater Blue-Green Algae - Lee County Environmental Lab/FDEP information

--

4. Receive various other data from SCCF Marine Lab and other Stakeholders

--

5. ...other valuable information .small[ (i.e. Shellfish advisory, Beach Conditions, Wildlife Impacts, USACE water management, etc.)]

--

6. Consolidate info into word document, pdf and post

### ...and now

Steps 1 -3 and 6 can all be done via webscraping, API access to data, consistent calculations and consolidation via Open Science applications. 

A rudimentary example in `R`: 

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(rvest)

LO.url="https://w3.saj.usace.army.mil/h2o/reports/r-oke.html"
webpage <- read_html(LO.url)
node.val <- html_nodes(webpage,"pre")

LO.text.vals <- html_text(node.val)

strsplit(as.character(LO.text.vals),"\n")[[1]][2:11]
```


---
name: how2

### ...and now

* Using reproducible open science information gathering can be stream-lined

* Removing time-constraint, more information can be also be included

* Short term trends, weekly water budgets, etc. 

* One stop shop for information - [link](https://sccf-tech.github.io/CRE_Conditions/report/RegionalConditions)

* If hosted through github (or other platforms) you can automate to auto-update (to some extent)

```{r ,fig.align="center",out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics('./Plots/ConditionsReport.png')
```

```{r ,fig.align="center",out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://media3.giphy.com/media/xT5LMRU6L8ccSgjKeY/giphy.gif')
```

--

The final conditions report is not 100% reproducible but is constructed using the daily [Regional Conditions](https://sccf-tech.github.io/CRE_Conditions/report/RegionalConditions) report

The [Regional Conditions](https://sccf-tech.github.io/CRE_Conditions/report/RegionalConditions) report is also used to propagate the [Weekly Water Conditions Tracker](https://www.sccf.org/water-quality/weekly-water-conditions-tracker).

--

.bold[Slowly evolving our process]

- External sources of data (light attenuation, salinity, etc.)

- As available or if suitable information is added such as drone images ([SCCF Drone](https://aerialwq.sccf.org/lighthouse/virtualtour/)), Wildlife, Algae conditions, etc.

name: sharing

### Sharing is caring

* Open science is a continuum (not open vs closed)

--

  * As code and tools are tested and put through its paces they can be shared (via GitHub, etc.)
  
  * Its not all or nothing
  
--

* How do I share my reports, cool data visualizations or tools?

--
  * [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
      * Build your own website hosted through Github (simple to fancy)
      * Here is our [https://sccf-tech.github.io/](https://sccf-tech.github.io/)... looks familiar? Because its based on [https://tbep-tech.github.io/](https://tbep-tech.github.io/)
--
  * [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)
      * Server product from RStudio for secure sharing of applications, reports and plots. 
--
  * Social Media
      * `r fontawesome::fa("twitter",fill="steelblue")`: Strong [#rstat](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstat&src=typed_query) community
      * [Example](https://twitter.com/SwampThingPaul/status/1462772974935846923?s=20&t=d2vCwaw1aiHweKcAUrG6qw)

### Conclusion

* Gone is the dark times of spreadsheets and countless folders of maps, graphs, etc.

* Data aggregation across multiple agencies provides a clearer look at conditions
  * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
  * United States Geological Survey
  * United States Army Corps of Engineers
  * South Florida Water Management District 
  * Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission
  * Florida Department of Environmental Protection
  * Lee County Environmental Lab
  * Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation Marine Lab
  * ...

* Integrating spatial data and data visualizations has also improved  how information is evaluated and conveyed 

* ...also occasionally we get to put together interesting ways to looks at large datasets to get a historical perspective on the system.
